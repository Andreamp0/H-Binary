# H-Binary
Welcome! This repository contains two simple Python scripts:

- `henc.py` – the H Encoder

- `hdec.py` – the H Decoder

These tools convert between regular binary (e.g. 01101111) and H Binary, where:

- 1 becomes H

- 0 becomes h

e.g. 01101111 → hHHhHHHH

# How to Use

Execute one of the two programs, then:

- input text into the H Encoder to get H Binary;

- input H Binary into the H Decoder to get the original text.

Enjoy your H-ing!
